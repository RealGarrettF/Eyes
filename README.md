# Eyes Project:

This project creates a set of eyes that is able to follow your cursor. As you move your cursor around the eyes, 
the eyes will follow your cursor 360 degree in whichever direction your mouse moves.

How to run: Download the zip file for this repository. Open the file and select the Eyes.html file and drag it onto your browser. Have fun!
    
Future Improvements: 
    
    - Give the ability to click to change the color of the eyes
    
    - Add a sigh sound when your cursor is directly above the eyes
                         
    - Add a selection interface in the top right that allows you to change the color of the background
